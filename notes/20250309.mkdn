# Wishbone conversion

I have found the need to convert the hapenny bus to a bus with a stall function.

Mainly for 8 bit csr that needs an extra cycle or two to read multiple bytes. 
It also means that XIP flash should be possible.

Anyway , this is major surgery. So it may take a while....


Apparent things to do.

1. add amaranth-soc 
1. add a 16bit Wishbone to the cpu 
1. wire it into fdbox and the ewbox 
1. rewrite the memory (to start) to the new bus
    1.1 check other socs for a wishbone bram memory.


---- 

Ok , got the FD box working. EW box , does not seem to be doing  the stuff
Jumps missing. 

Need to check the ack signal going through the to the arbiter.
